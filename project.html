            <h3>Portfolio Website</h3>
            <p>I created a personal portfolio website to showcase my projects, skills, and accomplishments as a Computer Science Engineering graduate. Built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, the site provides a professional online presence where visitors can explore my technical expertise, academic achievements, and hands-on projects. The website is designed with a clean and responsive layout, ensuring seamless navigation on any device. It serves as a platform to highlight my journey, showcase my work, and connect with potential employers and collaborators.</p>

       <h3>Build an AI Image generator Website</h3>
       <p>I developed an AI Image Generator website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that allows users to generate images based on custom text prompts. The website features a clean, responsive design with an intuitive interface that enables users to input descriptions, which are then processed by an AI model integrated via API. The front-end design is created using HTML and CSS for structure and styling, while JavaScript handles the logic for interacting with the AI service and dynamically updating the user interface. This project showcases my skills in web development, focusing on seamless user experiences and integrating AI functionality through modern web technologies.</p>
